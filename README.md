This literally is the output of a script I wrote just to play with the idea that someone could fake their "contribution activity", if they wanted to, on GitHub.

Therefore the person's "Contribution Activity" is a terrible measure of their productivity.

Especially when one considers that only public repositories are counted, and most consultants are working *by design* on private code
